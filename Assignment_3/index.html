            Geru is a student initiative that aims to create a univocal ecosystem between artisans and the common folk. It is a platform that explores physical and digital means to not only spread awareness of the craft but also celebrate it while providing the artisans with a prospective market outside their traditional means.
            Our website intends to offer a ‘Craft Quest’ for inquisitive tourists. This aims to utilize the fact that Rajasthan is one of the tourist hotspots of the country owing to its heritage and its magnetic atmosphere. This quest maps out your itinerary perfectly and allows you to not only see the miracles of Molela, but also around it. This is what makes it perfect for young tourists! Now they don’t need to invest in the plethora of websites before them, but just refer to ours. Not only that, our website offers this quest with an incentive!
